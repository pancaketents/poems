Rain

When rain falls like snow
I am reminded of you
Falling soft and slow

She walks along the path, not knowing what's in store
Hope rattles at the bottom of the amphor
If I make amends

I'm sending signals to the ocean, I know the waves don't speak
I know it's selfish to think I can be everything she needs
